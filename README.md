# Human-movement-classification-with-accelerometer
Project for Neural Networks and Biometrics lessons.

Purpose of this project is checking if neural network could classify type of movement based on accelerometer data (txt files). Representation of accelerometer data in next step is greyscale images. In this project there are three classes: stand (no movement), walk and run.

This project also conatins checking if resolution of prepared images matters.

Script "processing.py" allows you to create images from data of accelerometer. 

Script "train_test.py" allows you to create neural network, train and test it. Finally, script present you results of test based on images, which neural network didn't deal with.
